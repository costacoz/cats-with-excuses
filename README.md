# Flutter Riverpod project that uses excuses API. Built with TDD approach.

Flutter project based on riverpod with tests.

The project is divided into layers according to Clean Architecture approach:
 * presentation
 * domain
 * data

Sequence in which layers were created:

## 1. Entities (Domain Layer)

## 2. Repository Contracts (Domain Layer)

## 3. Use Cases (Domain Layer)
Here we start creating tests first, before the logic.
From now on, for each next point in this list, we are supposed to create tests first and then logic.
Use Cases are where the business logic gets executed. In case of this project they contain only the repository methods' invocations.

## 4. Models (Data Layer)

## 5. Repository Implementation (Data Layer)

## 6. Data Sources (Data Layer)

## 7. Provider (Presentation Layer)

## 8. Dependency Injection (Presentation Layer)

## 9. User Interface (Presentation Layer)
